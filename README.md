# 🔄 Bubble Sort in C

## 📌 Overview

This project contains the completed implementation of the **Bubble Sort algorithm** using the C programming language. Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting technique where adjacent elements are repeatedly compared and swapped until the array is sorted.

This project is part of my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice and focuses on understanding sorting fundamentals.
